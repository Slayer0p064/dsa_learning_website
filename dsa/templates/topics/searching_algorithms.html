        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficient retrieval:</strong> Searching algorithms, especially for sorted data, help quickly locate elements in large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized for large data:</strong> Algorithms like Binary Search have logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), making them suitable for searching in large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Used in AI & Databases:</strong> Searching is essential in many domains such as AI, where algorithms are used to find patterns, and in databases for efficient indexing and retrieval.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved performance with advanced algorithms:</strong> Techniques like Jump Search and Exponential Search reduce time complexity compared to brute force algorithms like Linear Search.</li>
            <li><strong>Less space complexity:</strong> Many searching algorithms, such as Binary Search, require only a small amount of additional space, making them efficient in terms of memory usage.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>❌ Disadvantages of Searching Algorithms:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Search requires sorted data:</strong> While efficient, Binary Search only works on sorted datasets. Sorting the data initially can take additional time (O(n log n)), which may be costly for large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear Search is inefficient:</strong> Linear Search has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, which makes it impractical for large datasets where other algorithms like Binary Search or Jump Search can perform much better.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity in advanced searches:</strong> Algorithms like Interpolation Search and Exponential Search have specific requirements, such as uniform or unbounded data distributions. If the data doesn't meet these conditions, the performance can degrade or even fail.</li>
            <li><strong>Jump Search is not ideal for small datasets:</strong> Jump Search, although faster than Linear Search for large datasets, requires extra computation to determine the optimal step size and may not be efficient for small datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpolation Search has limited use cases:</strong> This algorithm performs best on uniformly distributed data. For skewed or irregular data, its performance can be much worse than Binary Search.</li>
